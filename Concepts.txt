	- Granary -> can stock 15 units of Rice, Wheat

+ replacing building
	- bonus in prod when previous building in city
	- lua script to replace the old building on completion

+ new buildings
	- River docks : allow resource trade/transfer following rivers
	- Assembly : raise stability, raise separatism
	- Treadmills : convert wheat/rice to food (mutually exclusive with Rivermills)
	
+ Special resources buildings
	- to stock special resources (aka "Equipment", example: Iron Materiel)
	- no stock for special resources outside production buildings and those buildings
	- temporary buildings created when an unit required special resources is linked to a city ?

--===============================--

when destroying an unit in melee attack:
- capture % of wounded left
- capture % of materiel left
- capture % of horses left
- capture % of fuel left
- transform % of damaged vehicule to materiel

when destroying an unit in ranged attack:
- few % of wounded left -> defender city if linked
- everything else lost
- to do: leave materiel, fuel (wounded ? Horses ?) on the plot using assets

---------------------------------------------------------------

+ Units can have more components than expected by its HP left (just put them in reserve as surplus)

- excedental reserve is transfered to city if a supply line is open
- if excedent > max active then the component is lost (that situation shouldn't happen)

example:
- desertion in a mechanized units: remove the HP corresponding to the deserting personnel and put the Equipment corresponding to the HP lost in reserve.
- mechanical failure in case of low reliability: remove the HP corresponding to the Equipment damaged and put the personnel corresponding to the HP lost in reserve.
- chance of ejection/escape of the crew of an aircraft/vehicule destroyed in combat situation : when removing each Equipment corresponding to the HP lost in combat do a check and put unarmed crew in reserve (or wounded)

how to find which resources can be sold & which can be bought

- slider to sell until X % of stock left 
- slider to buy until Y % of stock filled
- slider to convert to another resource until Z % of stock left

converting a resource (in buildings like steel factory using coal and iron) has priority, so to always have a stock to sell, set Z > X, but the number of converted / buyed resources is limited per turn

for example a market could allows 10 units of each resources / turn or a stock exchange 100 units of each resources / turn


if X > Y 
    - will buy until Y % of stock filled
    - will sell until X % of stock left
    - and means will not buy if it's selling
if X < Y 
    - will always buy until Y % of stock filled
    - will sell until X % of stock left
    - can buy and sell at the same time

so maybe force X >= Y every time (if X = Y = % stock left -> no buying nor selling)

--[[ SUZERAINTY
--===============================--

Permanent agreement between 2 nations, 1 being considered less powerful (client score <65% of suzerain score ?)
Agreement can be revoked anytime by any party (with relation/thrust modifiers affected, may cause war), or by the client (without penalty) if its score became >85% of suzerain  

Client states types:

	+ Satellite State (modern, require same government))
		The term satellite state designates a country that is formally independent in the world,
		but under heavy political, economic and military influence or control from another country.
		- Suzerain can decide the Client diplomacy independantly of it's own (proxy war, ...)
		- de facto Non Agression Pact
		- Defensive Pact from Suzerain (more protected than a Puppet State, but how does that play with proxy war ?)
		- common Open Market	
		- common Open Borders			
	
	+ Associated state (modern) 
		An associated state is the minor partner in a formal, free relationship between a political territory with a degree of statehood and a (usually larger) nation,
		for which no other specific term, such as protectorate, is adopted.
		- Open Borders given to Suzerain
		- under complete military protection of Suzerain (give control of all its military land units, Defensive Pact from Suzerain)
		- not required to follow the Suzerain in wars
		- limited diplomacy (can't declare war independantly of Suzerain or join a different alliance than Suzerain')
		- de facto Non Agression Pact
		- common Open Market
		
	+ Puppet State (modern, can have different government)
		A puppet state is a metaphor of a state that is supposedly independent but is in fact dependent upon an outside power.
		It is nominally sovereign but effectively controlled by a foreign or otherwise alien power, for reasons such as financial interests.
		A puppet state preserves the external paraphernalia of independence like a name, flag, anthem, constitution, law codes and motto but in reality is an organ of another state which created or sponsored the government
		- Strict following of Suzerain diplomacy actions (DOW, DOF, Denounce, Embargo, ...), with lesser modifiers penalties
		- Suzerain can decide the Client diplomacy independantly of it's own (proxy war, ...)
		- Exchange Territorial Integrity and Non Agression Pact (But both exchange occupied territory before applying)
		- Open Borders given to Suzerain
		- Open Market given to Suzerain
		
	+ Colony (other continent, far from Capital city)
		In politics and history, a colony is a territory under the immediate political control of a state, distinct from the home territory of the sovereign.
		Some colonies were historically countries, while others were territories without definite statehood from their inception.
		The Metropolitan state is the state that owns the colony.
		Unlike a puppet state or satellite state, a colony has no independent international representation,
		and its top-level administration is under direct control of the metropolitan state.
		- Inherit the Diplomatic relations of the Suzerain (de faco Non Agression and Defensive Pacts but also follow in offensive wars and every diplomatic actions, including economics)
		- Open Borders given to Suzerain
		- Open Market given to Suzerain
		- Exchange Territorial Integrity
	
	+ Protectorate
		A protectorate, in its inception adopted by modern international law,
		is a dependent territory that has been granted local autonomy and some independence while still retaining the suzerainty of a greater sovereign state.
		In exchange for this, the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations, which may vary greatly, depending on the real nature of their relationship
		- Exchange Territorial Integrity
		- Exchange Non Agression Pact
		- More inclined to accept Suzerain diplomatic demands
		- Open Borders given to Suzerain
		- Open Market given to Suzerain
		- Defensive Pact from Suzerain
		
	+ Vassal State (pre-modern) -> Satellite State or Puppet State
		A vassal state is any state that is subordinate to another. The vassal in these cases is the ruler, rather than the state itself.
		Being a vassal most commonly implies providing military assistance to the dominant state when requested to do so.
		It sometimes implies paying tribute, but a state which does so is better described as a tributary state.
		In simpler terms the vassal state would have to provide military power to the dominant state.
		Today, more common terms are puppet state, protectorate or associated state.
		- Strict following of Suzerain diplomacy actions (DOW, DOF, Denounce, Embargo, ...), with lesser modifiers penalties
		- Must defend the Suzerain when attacked
		- Can have its own diplomacy (including declaration of war)
		- Exchange Territorial Integrity and Non Agression Pact (But both exchange occupied territory before applying)
		- Open Borders given to Suzerain
		- Open Market given to Suzerain
		
	+ Tributary State (pre-modern) -> Associated State or Satellite State
		The term tributary state refers to one of the two main ways in which a pre-modern state might be subordinate to a more powerful state.
		The heart of the relationship was that the tributary would send a regular token of submission (tribute) to the superior power.
		This token often took the form of a substantial transfer of wealth, such as the delivery of gold, produce, or slaves, 
		so that tribute might best be seen as the payment of protection money.
		- Give something to Suzerain (gold per turn, Open Market, ...)
		- Do not oppose Suzerain in diplomacy (Client count less negative modifiers to Suzerain action)
		- Exchange Territorial Integrity and Non Agression Pact

Hegemony as a possible victory condition ?

+ Creation
	- use dummy building for each unit, edit city screen to hide them (add column in building table)
	- Lua check for required resources for an unit in city at the start of a player turn to create or remove the dummy building

+ Components
	- allow excedents, but decay each turn
